To compile:
premake4 gmake
make

The code has been tested on gl14.

Manual:
The extra feature is adaptive anti-aliasing
hier_edge.png and nonhier_edge.png shows that the edges are detected successfully.
Only hier.png and nonhier.png are rendered with adaptive anti-aliasing due to time constraint. (ADAPTIVE_SAMPLING in A4.cpp was set to false when rendering the rest)

The unique scene includes two types of trees, a tent, water, a terrain and some clouds. I made the models.

The unique scene was rendered with a different background (bg11.jpg instead of bg.jpg).
